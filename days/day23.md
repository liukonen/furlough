# Day 23

A lot of carry over from day 22, as I worked till nearly 11pm refactoring and creating a new slack API for my bot. 
Today I also implemented Duck Duck go and Weather results, however, my new bot API is not being picked up right, so I guess this will have to be a future release.
I also signed up for more conferences, including ML.Net conference at the end of the month, as well as 24 hours of code (no sign up, but will participate)

Also got out, and got some air / sun
