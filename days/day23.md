# Day 23

A lot of carryover from day 22, as I worked till nearly 11 pm refactoring and creating a new slack API for my bot. 
Today I also implemented Duck Duck go and Weather results, however, my new bot API is not being picked upright, so I guess this will have to be a future release.
I also signed up for more conferences, including ML.Net conference at the end of the month, as well as 24 hours of code (no sign-up, but will participate)

Also got out, and got some air/sun

Afternoon update. Implemented a console-style bot interface for my chatbot, and got the weather and Duck Duck go items working solely on my slack client.
Javascript I can't because it requires external calls, and cross-site scripting is a no go.

That said, I have my new interface running as well, lets see how well the WebSocket holds up... as yesterday it crashed on me.

So I have a chatbot, that can now pull live weather and basic search result inquiries back, and less "scripted" responses in turn.
Not a bad day.
