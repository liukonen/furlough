# Day 19

In the morning I started to look for Power BI training... Why, because my workplace sent out an email with free training that I didn't do, and I want to be ahead of the curve when I get back. So I found on MS site, that they offered a free class... I signed up, only for them to want my work email, and a copy of office, installed... at the time, I have neither, so I stopped there, about halfway through the syllabus. 

That said, I found this 4 hours long "Power BI Full Course - Learn Power BI in 4 hours" and watched it instead
