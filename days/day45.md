# Day 45

Week 10... wow! I started the morning trying to get my Nats program cross-platform. What I found, however, is strange issues trying to bind the DLL's SQLite provides. I also attempted to then switch to the Microsoft edition, which code wise works great, but as soon as I attempt to open a connection string, it bombs out on me. Until I have more time to develop my own or find a new DB provider, I'm putting this down. Speaking of DB's, looking forward to tomorrows 2 day Mongo DB dev conference. I've never worked with Mongo before.
