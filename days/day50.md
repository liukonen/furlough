#Day 50

Week 11... Wow. One of the downsides is there are not as many conferences as there were earlier. Plus side is I can work on my pet projects a bit more. I started off the morning removing some of the "Master" branches from my workspaces. Github will soon be changing the default namespace due to the current political items going on now, and I wanted to be a bit ahead of the curve. That said, I broke all of my websites in the process. Turns out, you need "Master" in order for the websites to work. After that mess, I decided to work on 2 things for my furlough site. I implemented a search engine, which is powered by keywords. I have a second one-off app that generates a JSON file that contains all keywords and mapped text files. I also am powering a list view with the top 5 keywords in all of my documents. The top keyword of today, code. Who knew, lol. One other major change I made to my site is the files I am getting my information from. Rather than scrapping Html for every file, I am reading the underlying MD file, which cuts the data transfer by 4x per file. So if the 5 results showing was taking up 20k,  it should now be 5k, roughly.
