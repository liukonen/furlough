# Day 14

I wanted to learn some of the differences between MVP and MVC, as my work goes with more of an MVP then MVC approach. From what I can tell, entry points and responsibilities are slightly different between the two, however, they are fairly the same.

Also, I want to work on my tic tac math again... this time, I want to remove the majority of HTML and replace it with a template, as there is a lot of repetitive HTML in the doc. I may also lightly structure my code to MVC... as I want to separate much of my logic from the animations.
