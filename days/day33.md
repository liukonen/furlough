# Day 33
## MS Build Day 2
Participated in the MS Build Note section as well as a focus group on VS for Mac (Never thought I would ever do that, for one, I never thought I would own a mac, let alone develop on one). What else... more comments / questions on some of the topics. Everyone has been super helpful and I am glad I got to do this! I would in a heartbeat go to an in live version of this if I got the chance... I've learned alot about new products coming out!
