# Day 42

Today was agile training. Really got a lot out of it!
This afternoon... well.... I rolled back a bunch of changes on my Simple Weather app, and, lost my entire frontend work, so I will probibly spend some time, decompiling my code to try to get it back. If that doesn't work, I'll be building a new GTK UI for it. :(
