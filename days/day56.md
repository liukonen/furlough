# Day 56
## WWDC day 2

In the morning, I waited around to see when the videos would be available. Turns out noon is the magic time. Good to know for the rest of the week. That said, I ran my site through some accessibility engines, and while there are some small tweaks I can make, it's fairly good.
I also found a bug in Safari with loading the png files over the webp. Turns out my lazy load logic created a small bug that needed fixing.
One thing I do want to look at, either today or tomorrow is rewriting my parsing logic for my furlough site here. Right now I am loading Html files to get the weeks and days when I could be parsing off MD files, which are quite a bit smaller in size.

For WWDC 2020, I watched the following videos... I'll be watching more of today's videos tomorrow while waiting for the new batch. Also, tomorrow is a slack webcast.
