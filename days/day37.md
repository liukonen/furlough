# Day 37

I hate Xcode... well, not entirely, but it does give me a headache. I got my form generated and just the way I like it, and after making a small tweek to a control, my solution would build, but no longer work. This sucks, because I worked late last night in getting the UI to just where I wanted it. 

This afternoon, I am going to take a break from Visusal Studio.Mac and XCode and instead start looking at the docker container I pulled down from Stanford. Perhaps just play around with the sentiment anaylis engine I have. After all, Docker Con starts bright and early in the morning tommorrow.
