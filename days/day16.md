# Day 16

I came up with the mad idea of building a chatbot, but having EVERYTHING client side. Requires a 1.6 mg download of rules, but with compression turned on, its less than a half a meg.

Took old AIML scripts from a bot I last worked on in 2017, and updated some of the things in it. Then I converted it over to [RiverScript](https://www.rivescript.com/) text, took the frontend from there site, and retrofitted it for my use.

Added some interesting elements, published, it, then found out that GitHub does not like the URLS I create... 5 publishes later, and it's finally working.

So, I mean my learnings today include
 - HTML 5
 - JQuery
 - Javascript
 - RiveScript
 
 some improvements I can work on is combining translation services with the bot, so it is multilingual.. and perhaps having it verbally speak
