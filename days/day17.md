# Day 17

I spent too much time creating a home page. Much of the time was finding and editing images at first... lots of copy-paste, then saying F it, and using a JSON object to generate the main aspect of the page.
This way, if I want to add a project, I just update a JSON object, and it updates the page.
Items I'd like to expand on would be the 2020 furlough log... perhaps loading a list from stripping an HTML file.. not sure yet.

I also had to get a hold of my HR person, as I had some questions with an email sent out.

Second half of the day, I watched a few videos on channel 9 including

- [Quantium Machine Learning and Azure Quantum](https://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/AI-Show/Quantum-Machine-Learning-and-Azure-Quantum)
    - This video proves I still have a lot of learning to do... would not apply for me, YET
- [Making the case for AI chatbots and Power BI](https://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/On-NET/Making-the-case-for-AI-chat-bots-and-Power-BI)
    - Not much that I didn't know about already, that said, interesting case.
    - QnA maker ties to chatbot, response get logged as well as sentiment analysis
    - From that data can be outputted to Power BI dashboard. which gives insight on what the bot can improve on
