# Day 28

I am exhausted. I did nearly non stop videos until nearly 9:40 yesterday. I woke at 5:50 am, and continued watching until 7 am.
Last night, my slackbot became unresponsive again (partly because of the outage). Luckily, I finished up my python edition 2.0 bot, and fired her up. One bug I need to fix yet to Lcase the text... she won't give me weather info if I say Weather.
I also came up with a potential interesting fix for the .net version, however, since there seems to be a bug with .net core, Linux, SSL and WebSockets (I've googled around and it seems more and more to be a framework thing), I think I might put that down for a bit

Second half of my day, I did a crash course to Node.JS [Traversy Media Node.js Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBNz5xF-Kx4)
Didn't get a ton out of it, however, I would feel comfortable I think, working in Node.Js
