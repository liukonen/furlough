# Day 31

Busy week coming up. Started to hit the ground running. Hopefully, I won't burn out too fast.
I started out the day learning the Go Language. Nothing that shocking syntax wise, however, it did get me thinking about my site. I did find a bug on it, where one page I forgot to rename one of the menus. So, I put the generation of the menu object in a JSON file. That's not what Go inspired me to do though. Instead, what I did was moved all 3rd party libraries (font awesome, jquery, and Boostrap) into a Lib folder. That helps keep my code separate from other code, while still having access to everything. I don't plan on doing a ton today since tomorrow will be very interesting.
Ok, back to Go, where I learned based on the class I was taking, that its fairly low level yet functional. There are a lot of CS and math-based operations you can use right out of the box, like iota and or, and, and other statements on arrays of bits.

Partway through my learning, I found I was supposed to register for events for tomorrow's build event, so I spent some time doing that. Between that and calls I've been getting, I will not be finishing my go video today, however, hopefully, I'll be able to finish it up by the end of the week. I found Build is not a 2 day, but a 3-day event! 

Then, I got the message that my landlord is stopping in tomorrow, which means, time to pick up and clean.

I had to stop at the 3 hour 21 minute mark.

Other off the wall side note. Yesterday, I decided to play around with my laptop I own and attempt to Hackintosh it. I got it running, but, no wifi. What is the point of a laptop without wifi right? So once things start opening back up again, I might just have to buy a new wifi adapter for it.
