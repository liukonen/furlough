# Day 5
The first half of the day was spent watching 3 videos on .net core and Docker containers.
[intro to docker containers 101](https://channel9.msdn.com/Series/Docker-and-NET-Core-101)

<p>Then set up my local Git Server (Gogs) and CRM (Grav)</p>

The next day, I spent fitting the CMS tool to have blogs so I could keep track of all this. I also played with the local git, cloning 2 repos, one that is my own, and another for some software I use (the PHP scanner server software)
