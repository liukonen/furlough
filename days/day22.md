# Day 22

Happy Cinco De Mayo

I decided to port my Chatbot over to Slack... ran into a few issues, including the python code I found being a version or 5 behind. That said, I was able to get it up and running.
Coworkers are having fun asking it questions.

I also had a meeting with UWM to go over some things, which was really productive and made me feel pretty good about where I am.

This afternoon I have a Agile meetup to attend, so keeping the day light.
