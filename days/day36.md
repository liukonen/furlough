# Day 36    

I started the morning with a bike ride of all things. It was too nice out not too. I started riding again this weekend. It helps with the anxiety and depression, and gets me outside again.

Afterward, I decided to watch [The Art of Code - Dylan Beattie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6avJHaC3C2U) .
I also decided over the weekend that I wanted to port NATS as more than just a console application. While .net 5 and the new UWP framework is not out yet, I decided to make it a WinForms app, since that is MIT compliant on all platforms using mono, as well as possibly compiling it for the Mac Platform… That said, I did not get as far as I wanted. I was able to port the code over to .net standard, create a .net core, and .net framework CLI interface (not tested) as well as a .net Winform UI. that said, I am struggling to get my Windows index items returning, as well as my SQLite index to work. Much of it is related to DLL’s not copying when they should. I Still need to investigate this further.
