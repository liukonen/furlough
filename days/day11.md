- using Data Sockets in Node.JS,
- async communication and promises,
- Express (A Node.js framework for building API's and sites)
- Mongo DB
- Jade and Jade templates
- using middleware pre processors such as Styles
- Deploying node.js Apps to Azure sites
- Remote Debuging (view logs) on Azure Sites
