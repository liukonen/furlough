I watched a talk about clean code… good quote “code is how we tell the team how we feel about them”

I watched a few more seasons. All sessions will be online later :)

I'm also going to be honest. I worked on my Python Aiml bot for the second half of the day, and got it working great. Next time River (.net edition) goes down, I have a Python edition waiting to go
