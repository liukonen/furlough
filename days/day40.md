# Day 40

Wow, no conferences today! That said, I do have F# and some agile things this week. So, today I am...
-  working on my github homepage, cleaning up some of the UI
- Took my Dif project and made it cross platform
- Made some huge progress upconverting my simple weather App to be cross platform. 
    - rather then an app for every enviroment, sticking with the GTK# UI elements
    - Spent a good chunk of the day converting shared DLL's to .Net Standard
