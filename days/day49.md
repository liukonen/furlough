# Day 49

Today was a day I wanted to try out some new things. I watched some JS videos and found some major improvement items that I could implement on my homepage. Much of which revolves around the IntersectionObserver object, which from a performance standpoint, is way better than using a scrollbar event handler. I retrofitted some animation to the about me screen, animating progress bars when you scroll to them. I made my navigation bar transparent, and as you start to scroll, it dynamically switches back to solid. And the coolest thing was on my homepage, where I lazy load images. When you load the page, only the images that are visible on the screen are loaded. As you scroll, the JS reads off the Data-src attribute on the object and throws it in the src. So the image only loads into the browser as you scroll to it.  I also worked on some fading items on the screen as well, but I don't want to overload my screen with animations and make things dizzying. In the back of my mind, I know I'd like to somehow build a search engine for my furlough logs, but I want the performance to be on tap. I could let the search just do a raw search on pages, but that would be terrible. Instead, I might build a one-off to generate a list of keywords mapped to the files they are associated with. This could be stored in a JSON object, that can be checked in every day with my changes...  something to think about for the future.
