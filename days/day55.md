# Day 55

Week 12. 
This was supposed to be it. However, it looks like I will know more by the end of June.
That said, I have to keep making myself better. I started with my homepage. I realized even using templates, that my HTML may not be 100% HTML 5 compliant. So I spent the morning cleaning up my tab structure, validating HTML 5 compliance, and adding or fixing items where needed. Another pet peeve of mine is the modal I have on my blog page. Sometimes it works, and other times it doesn't. a good part of it is because of the Iframe I am using. So instead of an Iframe, I found a javascript engine that can take markdown and return HTML. So instead of redirecting to a themed site, I am now taking my markdown, converting it to straight HTML, and putting it on the modal itself. Works 100% better, however, for mobile, I will still do the redirect. The reason for that is a modal on a small screen really does not look good. 

I got all of this done well before the Apple keynote.

Watched both the Keynote and "Platforms State of the Union" presentations. A lot of interesting devices and tech coming through the pipeline. That said, it doesn't make me want to go out and jump on buying an Apple device right now.
