# Day 39
## ML dot Net Developer conference day 1
Since this conference extends to the weekend, and I dont want to mess up my date or days numbering system, I have a Saturday page for what I learn tomorrow.

Today is the workshop day for the ML.Net dev conference and I am set to go. Last night I also updated my Tic Tac Math game to accept touch input, so it is phone friendly.
Really got a lot out of it, as we build our own models and then in turn, hooked them up to a web ui.
