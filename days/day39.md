# Day 39
## ML dot Net Developer conference day 1
Since this conference extends to the weekend, and I dont want to mess up my date or days numbering system, I have a Saturday page for what I learn tomorrow.

Today is the workshop day for the ML.Net dev conference and I am set to go. Last night I also updated my Tic Tac Math game to accept touch input, so it is phone friendly.
Really got a lot out of it, as we build our own models and then in turn, hooked them up to a web ui.

Oh, and one more thing, which is really cool! I released my first GTK+ (Cross platform) and Cocoa (Mac OS native) based application on my github. Well, its the same app behind the scenes. I wanted a nice user interface for my Nats project, but I did not want to limit it to just windows. I also did not want to have to wait for .net 5.0 to come out. The app looks fantastic, and I am super happy with it. There are some bugs, due to dll's not wanting to work on my PCs, but that only prevents users from using Windows Indexed or custom indexed searchs. This can be phase 2.
