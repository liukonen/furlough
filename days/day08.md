# Day 8

I started the day off late, since I thought my landlord would show up at some time in the morning, as water is dripping from my bathroom walls again.
That said. I started googling design patterns again, since I wanted to keep it a bit light today. 
- Watched [](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NU_1StN5Tkk) which was a win, even though the first half was very intro
  - since I learned the Memento pattern, which made sure every class used single responsibility
  - Learned the State pattern as well, which reminds me of a lightweight abstract factory
  - Also, something we don't follow enough is the open-close principle, which keeps the system dynamic enough for changes, while closed off for most modifications (unless there is a rewrite or bug that needs fixing) Point is, if you follow single-use and open-closed, most items and bugs will not break bigger things downstream)
  - and also refreshed some of my Java syntax and programming skills (since Java is so much like c#, I think I would feel comfortable writing in Java again)
  - Biggest note: don't abuse design patterns.
