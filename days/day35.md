# Day 35
Kind of a continuation of where I left off yesterday. After the build session, I decided that my laptop, which has been running Pop-os, should get an upgrade.
So, I wiped my drive since it was encrypted, I couldn't just resize it) and installed first Windows 7 pro (since that was its last os)
followed up with a fresh install of Windows 10 pro along with tools and toys (including some new ones from Build, like the new Powertoys and Terminal).
 I installed the WSL platform and got Debian and Ubuntu running, however, since this is Pro, I couldn't get WSL2 running (yet). 
That right now is reserved for insiders on the Pro platform. 
This machine also as Catalena on a separate drive and Cloverleaf seems to pick up on the second drive perfectly. 
At some point however, I will want to upgrade the drives internal to a 1TB SSD... with 4 partitions at 250gigs.
 One for Linux, Windows, and Mac, as well as a 250 Partition for personal files (even though I have a network drive for that). 
Also waiting on the new WIFI card which should arrive today for the laptop, so that Mac OS can connect to WIFI and I'm not stuck with a cord.
 Today, I think I will focus on starting to develop a win UI for NATS.
 I want a Xamerain based UI so the app can run on all platforms. 
We'll see if I can get what I want with it though.
 Also since my Apartment is now under construction again, I will have to keep today light. 
Maybe a video or 2 on Agile practices. 
 After 4 hours straight on the Go language, and the videos last week on Node JS and Python, I'm not sure what I am taking out of these videos other than the semantics of that language.
 I do know I need a refresher on Java, however looking back at my old Java books from college, I don't see a lot of differences between that and C#... but I might be wrong. 
I'll save that for next week.
 I also plan to make Monday a personal day, and not a development day. 
Since I would have had off on Monday if I were working AND I am still burnt out from Build. 
The video conference was SO worth it, and I would do it, or even live attend, if I got the chance.
