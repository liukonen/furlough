# Day 10

Between grocery shopping, and other activities, I wasn't able to get as much studying done as I would have hoped to.
That said. I did finish up the GraphQL series [Consuming-GraphQL-in-C](https://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/On-NET/Consuming-GraphQL-in-C)

It is intersting with using Xamerian to develop native IOS and Android apps in C#. This might be something to look into later.
