# Day 7: Python 
- Starting the day learning python... while I have a base understanding of it... I wanted to learn more [Intro to Python Development](https://channel9.msdn.com/Series/Intro-to-Python-Development)
    - with some breaks, got through 1-23, skipping many of the demos, since I understood exactly what they were talking about in the items
    - For the heck of it, played around with installing GitKracken and Visual Studio Code for writing up and sharing these writeups
    - Lunch Break
    - Then more training, and cleaned up my [cloudy-pie](https://github.com/liukonen/cloudy-pie) source code to use 4 space instead of single... while it compiles, best practice is 4 spaces.


Overall while this was an intro course, I did take away several things, such as Virtual Environments, that I did not know about before...
That said, guys voice drove me nuts... thank god it was only half of the videos.
