# Day 6
- Started the morning learning Git [Team Services Git Tutorial](https://channel9.msdn.com/series/Team-Services-Git-Tutorial)
	- I knew to get already, and have a good base understanding
	- Not too many differences between it and TFS... other then Check-ins are not the same as Check-ins, as Check-ins in TFS are a check-in and a push in Git
	- Seams like a lot of 2 stepping, which is ok... biggest concern is how many darn branches you can create, and no real way of having a "shelveset" in any way
	- I'm sure I'll learn more about it, as it seems to be the next go to...
- Followed up by watching how Git has some built-in CICD pipelines... I got suckered in by the title [GitHub Actions](https://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/Visual-Studio-Toolbox/GitHub-Actions)
- Also, something I learned last week was a lot about the Markdown language, with my CMS provider
- Set up a Github repo to share these documents... in case anyone wants to follow along with me during this time
- Another Git video [Git Fundamentals](https://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/Visual-Studio-Toolbox/Git-Fundamentals?term=git&lang-en=true)
	- this video was pretty good, and went over command line and VS versions of git 

Only a half-day of studying today... I decided to take a break and start cleaning... that said, I found several books and PDF's that I really should start reading as well
