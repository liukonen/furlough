# Day 12

Wanted to keep it a bit light today... maybe dedicate some time to cleaning up code on projects on github later... Anyway

Watched C# advanced tips
 - Linq statements, which I am already fairly familure with
 - Learned about Try .net... might want to host something like that locally (a web based GUI to test .net code)
 - Async and Await, again, already kind of knew
 
 Overall this series was very high level, and didn't really deep dive into anything.
