# Day 12

Wanted to keep it a bit light today... maybe dedicate some time to cleaning up code on projects on github later... Anyway

Watched C# advanced tips
 - Linq statements, which I am already fairly familure with
 - Learned about Try .net... might want to host something like that locally (a web based GUI to test .net code)
 - Async and Await, again, already kind of knew
 
 Overall this series was very high level, and didn't really deep dive into anything.

After studying, I played around with a few things.
I want to, started to, refactor my TicTacToe game to C#... however, A coworker indicated that there are MS like Agents you can use in Javascript. I may start rewriting it in JS. That said, I wanted to find cheap hosting... which I did. Turns out Github offers hosting of basic websites. So I took my Javascript based text editor, and published it... it can be found [here](https://liukonen.github.io/htmlTextEditor/)
