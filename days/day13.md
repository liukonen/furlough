# Day 13

This is a continuation of day 12. 
After my last update, I kept chugging along with converting Tic Tac Math to a Javascript-based web app.

Made the app 100% client-side, implemented Jquery calls along with using 3rd party tools, mainly Clippy.JS.
I also used some nice built in-browser tools, such as Text to Speech and local storage for saving the attributes.

Played around with more complex object types as well, like arrays and objects. Overall, very happy with the project, and glad I did it. No way of actually proving the learning works without actually diving in and programming. 

Some other ideas I got to play with is hosting a simple python web host in Mac (which I'm sure could work with Linux), Git, publishing on GitHub. and using an IDE other than visual studio.

I may still convert the VB app over to C#... but way less in priority... I mean, there were some good ideas I had going into it, using object structures.... so I think it's worth it, but it will probably never be released, other than source code.
