# Day 38
## Docker Con

Today's game plan is attending the virtual Docker con event going on today. Should hopefully get a lot out of it. In other news, I made good progress with my Nats Mac edition app... a bit of fine-tuning yet between the windows and Mac app before release. I also want to develop the Linux GUI version before release as well.
