# Day 20

I had to get up early today for shopping, so I'm not into heavy learning. Instead I decided to work on my site. 2 things I want to work on, but not sure how far I will get.
- 1: Split my furlough site up to Week segments, then days. for
- 2: Create JS to strip my site, and convert it into a bootstrap menu automagically
- 3: Also create a template for my resume, and generate a JS file to take my resume JSON object and have a page for it

I also signed up for the MS build conference, and shared it with my coworkers on Slack...

So.... not sure how far I will get.... well 10 pm rolls around and I am just finishing up my resume portion.. some small things needed fixing. Next week I should go through my resume and make sure it looks good. For now, checking in my items, and heading to bed. I feel like I got a lot done.
