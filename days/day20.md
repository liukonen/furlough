# Day 20

Had to get up early today for shopping, so Im not into heavy learning. Instead I decided to work on my site. 2 things I want to work on, but not sure how far I will get.
- 1: Split my furlough site up to Week segments, then days. for
- 2: Create JS to strip my site, and convert it into a bootstrap menu automagicly
- 3: Also create a template for my resume, and generate a JS file to take my resume JSON object and actually have a page for it
